📌 Introduction

This application is designed for civil engineers and surveyors to calculate and visualize clothoid (Euler spiral) transition curves used in road and railway design. The program implements the exact mathematical models presented in the University of Tehran's "Route Surveying 07-Transition Curve" course material.

    Exporting:

        Use "Export to Excel" for construction data

        Use "Export to PDF" for full report

📊 Technical Details
Key Formulas Implemented:
python
# Route Surveying 07-Transition Curve
# From page 22
A = sqrt(L_s * R_c)
θ_s = L_s / (2 * R_c)

# From page 25
T_s = X_s - R_c*sin(θ_s) + (R_c + p)*tan(Δ/2)
E_s = (R_c + p)/cos(Δ/2) - R_c

# From page 28
δ_i = (L_i²)/(6*L_s*R_c)  # Deflection angle

Stationing Calculation (page 31-32):
python

Km_A = Km_T1 + L_s
L_c = R_c * radians(Δ) - L_s  # Circular curve length
Km_B = Km_A + L_c
Km_T2 = Km_B + L_s
